= Overview =

Lua Built-In program (L-Bia) is a self-running Lua interpreter. It turns
your Lua program with all required modules (either Lua or C libraries)
and an interpreter into a single stand-alone program.

L-Bia makes the things simpler. First because you don't need to distribute
may files. Last because you can run the resulting program directly, in any
computer from any media (flopies, CD-ROMs, USB sticks or other), without
installing it or have any prior software installed.

= Availability =

L-Bia is freely available under the terms of GNU General Public License.
Contrary to popular belief, it can be used in comercial software! See
[COPYING copying.html] for details. The latest version of L-Bia can be
downloaded from its [LuaForge http://luaforge.net/projects/l-bia/files/]
page.

= Build and Install =

If you're using the usual Unix tools, in most cases you can just type
``make``. This will compile everything with the default options. To
change the options, modify or include C/C++ user code edit Makefile
and/or lbconf.h.

If you're on Windows or other systems without the usual Unix tools, then
the instructions for building L-Bia depend on the compiler you use. You'll
need to create projects (or whatever your compiler uses) for building the
library (``lbaux.dll`` on Windows) and the program (``l-bia.exe`` on
Windows), as follows:

```
library: lbaux.c minilzo.c

program: l-bia.c minilzo.c
```

Then run l-bia on l-bia this way:
``lua l-bia.lua -i program l-bia.lua``.

As L-Bia uses L-Bia, it needs no installation at all. You don't need library
any more. The only file needed to use the program is ``l-bia`` executable
(``l-bia.exe`` on Windows). If you want to "install" L-Bia on the system, just
copy it to a system PATH directory.

= How do I use it? =

Just type ``l-bia hello.lua`` for each program you want to turn into a
stand-alone program. It will create a ``hello`` executable (``hello.exe``
on Windows) ready to use. If you disbled the L-Bia built-in //chmod//
feature and you're on Unix systems, you will need type ``chmod +x hello``
first in order to make it executable. Of course you can use any name
instead of //hello//.

If your script uses modules, you must run L-Bia for main script only. L-Bia
automatically search for all require'd modules and include then. There is no
need for ``l-bia *.lua``.

The command-line arguments passed to your stand-alone program will be
available in a table called "arg" and also as "...".

Type ``l-bia`` with no arguments, to see a list of command-line options
and a brief help about it.

= Thanks =

Thanks to **Waldemar Celes** and **Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo**, the autors
of Lua, for portions of code I used in L-Bia. Tanks also to
**Markus Franz Xaver Johannes Oberhumer** for miniLZO - mini subset of the
LZO real-time data compression library.
