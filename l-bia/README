= What is L-Bia? =

Lua Built-In program (L-Bia) is a self-running Lua interpreter. Use it
to get your Lua program, your C/C++ user code and a Lua interpreter into
a single, stand-alone program.

= Availability =

L-Bia is freely available under the terms of GNU General Public License.
Contrary to popular belief, it can be used in comercial software! See
[COPYING copying.html] for details. The latest version of L-Bia can be
downloaded from its [LuaForge http://luaforge.net/projects/l-bia/files/]
page.

= Installation =

The Makefile is targeted at Unix and Windows/mingw systems. Just edit it
and/or lbconf.h to suit your needs and do ``make release`` or ``make debug``.
This will build ``l-bia``, copy it to a suitable place.

= How do I use it? =

For each Lua program that you want to trun into a stand-alone program,
do ``l-bia hello.lua`` and ``hello`` to run. For Unix systems if //chmod//
feature isn't available, you need do ``chmod +x hello`` first. Of course,
you can use any name instead of //hello//.

The command-line arguments will be available to the Lua program in a table
called "arg" and also as "...". Use lbconf.h to select which standard Lua
libraries and features will be available.

To include C/C++ user code edit ``lbconf.h``. If your user code is C++
do ``make release CC=g++``. See ``lbaux.c`` for an example.

= Thanks =

Thanks to **Waldemar Celes** and **Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo**, the autors
of Lua, for portions of code I used in L-Bia. Tanks also to
**Markus Franz Xaver Johannes Oberhumer** for miniLZO - mini subset of the
LZO real-time data compression library.
